\n\nDescription\nThis repository serves as the backend for my personal portfolio. It provides a RESTful API to manage core data structures including users, professional experiences, projects, and contact inquiries.\nKey Technical Stack:\n\nFramework: NestJS (TypeScript)\nORM: TypeORM\nDatabase: PostgreSQL / MySQL\nDocumentation: Swagger (OpenAPI 3.0)\nSecurity: JWT Authentication & Class-Validator\n\n\nAPI Documentation (Swagger)\nThe project includes a built-in interactive API explorer using Swagger. This allows you to visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic.\nHow to Access\n\nStart the application (npm run start:dev).\nOpen your browser and navigate to:\nhttp://localhost:3000/api\n\n\n\nWhat's Inside:\n\nSchemas: Detailed view of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Entity structures.\nEndpoints: Test GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests directly from the UI.\nAuthentication: Clear labeling of public vs. protected routes.\n\n\nProject setup\nExample :$ npm installCompile and run the project\nExample :# development\n$ npm run start\n\n# watch mode\n$ npm run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ npm run start:prodRun tests\nExample :# unit tests\n$ npm run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ npm run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ npm run test:covDeployment\nWhen you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the deployment documentation for more information.\nIf you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out Mau, our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:\nExample :$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau\n$ mau deployWith Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.\nResources\nCheck out a few resources that may come in handy when working with NestJS:\n\nVisit the NestJS Documentation to learn more about the framework.\nFor questions and support, please visit our Discord channel.\nTo dive deeper and get more hands-on experience, check out our official video courses.\nDeploy your application to AWS with the help of NestJS Mau in just a few clicks.\nVisualize your application graph and interact with the NestJS application in real-time using NestJS Devtools.\nNeed help with your project (part-time to full-time)? Check out our official enterprise support.\nTo stay in the loop and get updates, follow us on X and LinkedIn.\nLooking for a job, or have a job to offer? Check out our official Jobs board.\n\nSupport\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project. It can grow thanks to the sponsors and support by the amazing backers.
